# Sequence

## Plan

The idea is a game where, given a set of rules, the player has to deduce a sequence of numbers.
Rules are either mandatory or forbidden constellations. E.g. `13` means the numbers 1 and 3 must/most not appear next to each other in that order. `|2` means 2 must/must not be the first number in the sequence.

The first version should run in the command line and generate random sets of rules with *exactly one* solution.

## Further ideas

1. Build a simple GUI
2. Introduce more complexity (combination of symbols, 2D etc.)
3. Add curated puzzles (tutorial, rise in difficulty)
4. Make it a full game (save progress, graphics, sound etc.)
5. Port to mobile
